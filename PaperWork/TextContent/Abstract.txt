We here discuss whether we can employ neural nets to secure our communication channels. We take classic Alice, Bob and Eve example where Alice is trying to send a message to Bob and Eve is eavesdropping. Instead of using rigid symmetric encryption algorithms like AES, DES, we will create an adversarial neural network where Alice will be trained to encrypt using a shared key, Bob will be trained to decrypt using a shared key and Eve will be trained to reconstruct the message without a shared key.
