Today, there are several types of neural networks which are used for various purposes. As we discover more ways of exploiting their potential, we ask whether they can also be used to make our communication secure and replace the existing rigid cryptographic algorithms. For sake of this paper, we will focus on symmetric encryption algorithms.

Symmetric cryptosystem can be easily explained by a classic example of three people named Alice, Bob and Eve. We assume that Alice and Bob have shared a secret key. Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob which she encrypts using their shared secret key to create ciphertext, Alice sends this ciphertext to Bob through a channel, presumably insecure. Bob uses the same shared secret key to decrypt the ciphertext. When ciphertext was intercepted by Eve but she canâ€™t decrypt it without the shared secret key.
